That is, if you can't solve an exercise, you can still move on and try the next one. **However, if you see a code cell introduced by the phrase, \"Sample result for ...\", please run it.** Some demo cells in the notebook may depend on these precomputed results.\n",

    "- All test cells use **randomly generated inputs.** Therefore, try your best to write solutions that do not assume too much. To help you debug, when a test cell does fail, it will often tell you exactly what inputs it was using and what output it expected, compared to yours.\n",
    "- If you need a complex SQL query, remember that you can define one using a [triple-quoted (multiline) string](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/introduction.html#strings).\n",
    "- If your program behavior seem strange, try resetting the kernel and rerunning everything.\n",
    "- If you mess up this notebook or just want to start from scratch, save copies of all your partial responses and use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Reset Assignment` to get a fresh, original copy of this notebook. _(Resetting will wipe out any answers you've written so far, so be sure to stash those somewhere safe if you intend to keep or reuse them!)_\n",
    "- If you generate excessive output (e.g., from an ill-placed `print` statement) that causes the notebook to load slowly or not at all, use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Clear Notebook Output` to get a clean copy. The clean copy will retain your code but remove any generated output. **However**, it will also **rename** the notebook to `clean.xxx.ipynb`. Since the autograder expects a notebook file with the original name, you'll need to rename the clean notebook accordingly. Be forewarned: we won't manually grade \"cleaned\" notebooks if you forget!\n",

The observations consist of about 1 million product reviews, where for each review, a user rates a book on a scale of 1-5 and then writes a short comment.\n",

But your hunch is that users interested in a certain type of book (e.g., books about business or sports) tend to rate and review similar books.
