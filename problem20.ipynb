    "In this notebook, you'll implement a procedure that attempts to summarize a long document by identifying and ranking important sentences _automatically_. It exercises your understanding of the singular value decomposition (SVD), Numpy, and some basic Python string manipulation. It is worth ten (10) points in total. While the exercises build on one another conceptually, we have precomputed solutions you'll need in each instance so that you can complete them in any order, similar to the Midterm 2 problems.\n",

(_Resetting will wipe out any answers you've written so far, so be sure to stash those somewhere safe if you intend to keep or reuse them!_)\n",
    "- If you generate excessive output (e.g., from a ill-placed `print` statement), causing the notebook to load slowly or not at all, use `Actions` $\\rightarrow$ `Clear Notebook Output` to get a clean copy. The clean copy will retain your code but remove any generated output. **However**, it will also **rename** the notebook to `clean.xxx.ipynb`. Since the autograder expects a notebook file with the original name, you'll need to rename the clean notebook accordingly.\n",
